# Soft Actor Critic

The paper Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement
Learning with a Stochastic Actor by Tuomas Haarnoja et al. introduces
a different off-policy algorithm for continuous action space.

~~~
The general idea is to introduce entropy directly in the value function we want
to maximize.
