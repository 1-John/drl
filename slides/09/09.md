# Continuous Action Space

Until now, the actions were discrete. However, many environments naturally
accept actions from continuous space. We now consider actions which come
from range $[a, b]$ for $a, b ∈ ℝ$, or more generally from a Cartesian product
of several such ranges:
$$∏_i [a_i, b_i].$$

A simple way how to parametrize the action distribution is to choose them from
the normal distribution.

Given mean $μ$ and variance $σ^2$, probability density function of $𝓝(μ, σ^2)$
is
$$p(x) ≝ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 π σ^2}} e^{\large-\frac{(x - μ)^2}{2σ^2}}.$$

# Continuous Action Space in Gradient Methods

Utilizing continuous action spaces in gradient-based methods is straightforward.
Instead of the $\softmax$ distribution we suitably parametrize the action value,
usually using the normal distribution. Considering only one real-valued action,
we therefore have
$$π(a | s; →θ) ≝ P\Big(a ∼ 𝓝\big(μ(s; →θ), σ(s; →θ)^2\big)\Big),$$
where $μ(s; →θ)$ and $σ(s; →θ)$ are function approximation of mean and standard
deviation of the action distribution.

The mean and standard deviation are usually computed from the shared
representation, with
- the mean being computed as a regular regression (i.e., one output neuron
  without activation);
- the standard variance (which must be positive) being computed again as
  a regression, followed most commonly by either $\exp$ or
  $\operatorname{softplus}$, where $\operatorname{softplus}(x) ≝ \log(1 + e^x)$.

# Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem

Combining continuous actions and Deep Q Networks is not straightforward.
In order to do so, we need a different variant of the policy gradient theorem.

Recall that in policy gradient theorem,
$$∇_→θ J(→θ) ∝ ∑_{s∈𝓢} μ(s) ∑_{a ∈ 𝓐} q_π(s, a) ∇_→θ π(a | s; →θ).$$

## Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem
Assume that the policy $π(s; →θ)$ is deterministic and computes
an action $a∈ℝ$. Then under several assumptions about continuousness, the
following holds:
$$∇_→θ J(→θ) ∝ 𝔼_{s∼μ(s)} \Big[∇_→θ π(s; →θ) ∇_a q_π(s, a)\big|_{a=π(s;→θ)}\Big].$$

The theorem was first proven in the paper Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms
by David Silver et al.

# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients

Note that the formulation of deterministic policy gradient theorem allows an
off-policy algorithm, because the loss functions no longer depends on actions
(similarly to how expected Sarsa is also an off-policy algorithm).

We therefore train function approximation for both $π(s; →θ)$ and $q(s, a; →θ)$,
training $q(s, a; →θ)$ using a deterministic variant of the Bellman equation:
$$q(S_t, A_t; →θ) = 𝔼_{R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}} \big[R_{t+1} + γ q(S_{t+1}, π(S_{t+1}; →θ))\big]$$
and $π(s; →θ)$ according to the deterministic policy gradient theorem.

The algorithm was first described in the paper Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning
by Timothy P. Lillicrap et al. (2015).

The authors utilize a replay buffer, a target network (updated by exponential
moving average with $τ=0.001$), batch normalization for CNNs, and perform
exploration by adding a normal-distributed noise to predicted actions.
Training is performed by Adam with learning rates of 1e-4 and 1e-3 for the
policy and critic network, respectively.

# Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient

The paper Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods by
Scott Fujimoto et al. from February 2018 proposes improvements to DDPG which

- decrease maximization bias by training two critics and choosing minimum of
  their predictions;

- introduce several variance-lowering optimizations:
  - delayed policy updates;
  - target policy smoothing.

# TD3 – Maximization Bias

Similarly to Q-learning, the DDPG algorithm suffers from maximization bias.
In Q-learning, the maximization bias was caused by the explicit $\max$ operator.
For DDPG methods, it can be caused by the gradient descent itself. Let
$→θ_\textit{approx}$ be the parameters maximizing the $q_→θ$ and let
$→θ_\textit{true}$ be the hypothetical parameters which maximise true $q_π$,
and let $π_\textit{approx}$ and $π_\textit{true}$ denote the corresponding
policies.

~~~
Because the gradient direction is a local maximizer, for sufficiently small
$α<ε_1$ we have
$$𝔼\big[q_→θ(s, π_\textit{approx})\big] ≥ 𝔼\big[q_→θ(s, π_\textit{true})\big].$$

~~~
However, for real $q_π$ and for sufficiently small $α<ε_2$ it holds that
$$𝔼\big[q_π(s, π_\textit{true})\big] ≥ 𝔼\big[q_π(s, π_\textit{approx})\big].$$

~~~
Therefore, if $𝔼\big[q_→θ(s, π_\textit{true})\big] ≥ 𝔼\big[q_π(s, π_\textit{true})\big]$,
for $α < \min(ε_1, ε_2)$
$$𝔼\big[q_→θ(s, π_\textit{approx})\big] ≥ 𝔼\big[q_π(s, π_\textit{approx})\big].$$

# TD3 – Maximization Bias

~~~
Analogously to Double DQN we could compute the learning targets using
the current policy and the target critic, i.e., $r + γ q_{→θ'}(s', π_→θ(s'))$
(instead of using target policy and target critic as in DDPG), obtaining DDQN-AC algorithm.
However, the authors found out that the policy changes too slowly and the target
and current networks are too similar.

~~~
Using the original Double Q-learning, two pairs of actors and critics could be
used, with the learning targets computed by the opposite critic, i.e.,
$r + γ q_{→θ'_2}(s', π_{→θ_1}(s))$ for updating $q_{→θ_1}$. The resulting DQ-AC
algorithm is slightly better, but still suffering from oversetimation.

# TD3 – Algorithm

The authors instead suggest to employ two critics and one actor. The actor is
trained using one of the critics, and both critics are trained using the same
target computed using the _minimum_ value of both critics as
$$r + γ \min_{i=1,2} q_{→θ'_i}(s', π_{→θ}(s')).$$

~~~
Furthermore, the authors suggest two additional improvements for variance
reduction.
- For obtaining higher quality target values, the authors propose to train the
  critics more often. Therefore, critics are updated each step, but the actor
  and the target networks are updated only every $d$-th step ($d=2$ is used in
  the paper).

~~~
- To explictly model that similar actions should lead to similar results,
  a small random noise is added to performed actions when computing the target
  value:
  $$r + γ \min_{i=1,2} q_{→θ'_i}(s', π_{→θ}(s') + ε)~~~\textrm{for}~~~
    ε ∼ \operatorname{clip}(𝓝(0, σ), -c, c).$$
